async code 
js is synchronous
js is single-threaded

exceution context 
call stack
execution context is created when function is called
execution context is destroyed when function returns
 
 exceute one line of code at a time
call stack is a data structure that stores the execution context of the functions
call stack is a LIFO data structure
when a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack
when a function returns, its execution context is popped off the call stack
when the call stack is empty, the program is finished executing
the call stack is a data structure that stores the execution context of the functions

each operation is executed in the order it is called

blocking code and non blocking code
blocking code is code that stops the execution of the program until it is finished executing (for example, a for loop)Sync code is code that stops the execution of the program until it is finished executing (for example, a for loop)


non blocking code is code that does not stop the execution of the program until it is finished executing
(for example, a setTimeout function) async code is code that does not stop the execution of the program until it is finished executing (for example, a setTimeout function)
